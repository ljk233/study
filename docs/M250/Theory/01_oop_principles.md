# Principles in OOP

## Abstraction

## Encapsulation

**Reference:** U4.7

**Encapsulation** is the parcelling up of information and behaviour into a reusable component.
Objects allow the encapsulation of data by incorporating into a single entity (object) both the data (instance variables) and the behaviour (methods) defined for that data.

It is implemented in Java by using defined classes that act as templates for the creation of objects, which encapsulate both the state and behaviour of the object through **data hiding.**
Data hiding is the principle of only providing access to `private` instance variables through a limited set of `public` methods.
