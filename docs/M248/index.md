# Introduction

The purpose of this note is to provide a list of references for my study of **M248: Analysing data**.
There would be little utility is reproducing the notes, given that the Open University already provides a fantastic source of notes in the Handbook and the study text.

The example links direct to a computer activity completed in `Python`.
They provide little use to the study of **M248** (given that the module uses **Minitab**), and is so mainly for interest and colour.
They were written using **Atom + Hydrogen**, as I found Jupyter notebook irritating to version control in GitHub.
They could also be used with some other IDE, such as Spyder.
